Description: auto-generated package by debmake
 The GDBM package contains the GNU Database Manager. It is a library of
 database functions that uses extensible hashing and works like the standard
 UNIX dbm. The library provides primitives for storing key/data pairs,
 searching and retrieving the data by its key and deleting a key along with its
 data.
